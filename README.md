My first recipe website project
I recently started taking the course from The Odin Project and this is the first project offered.
I'm going to make a multi-page website: the main page and several links to recipes for various delicacies.
I will practice the acquired skills in using html.
Maybe later, when I know more, I'll come back to this project to make it a little prettier.
